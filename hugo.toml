Hi, I’m Diogo!

I’m currently pursuing my **MSc in Systems, Control and Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, where I focus on intelligent robotic perception and learning-based systems. I’m particularly interested in building machines that can understand, interpret and navigate complex real-world environments.

At the moment, I’m conducting my master’s thesis research at **Ericsson Research**, working on extracting spatially consistent information from previously learned scene representations to enable accurate 6-DoF metric pose estimation. My work sits at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning, with applications in large-scale spatial understanding and autonomous systems.

My academic journey began with a **BSc in Aerospace Engineering at IST**, where I developed a strong foundation in control systems, dynamics and applied mathematics. While I am still drawn to aerospace (mainly avionics and space), the rapid advances in large language models and autonomous technologies sparked in me a deeper interest in intelligent systems. That shift led me towards AI and robotics, where I found very interesting the challenge of making models interact meaningfully with the physical world.

Since then, I’ve gained experience with PyTorch, ROS2, CUDA and building robotic pipelines. I’m particularly drawn to problems where perception, learning and control intersect, especially when I can do practical things and turn theory into systems that operate reliably in the real world.

Outside of research, I stay grounded through music, film and time outdoors. I also enjoy volunteering and value environments where curiosity, collaboration and continuous learning are part of the culture.

I’m always happy to connect with people who are excited about robotics, AI or interesting engineering challenges.
